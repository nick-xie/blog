Being halfway through my second year at the University of Waterloo, it may surprise many that I made my first trip to the school library only a mere two months ago in late October.

Shocking.

Now, the one thing I omitted with that sentence is that it was the first time I went to the library with the sole intent just to *read*. Sure, I had visited the library before whether it had been for a group study session or to look for a resource for class but I had never simply sat down and enjoyed the silence. And with this small addition, I'm willing to bet that all of a sudden, I'm not so unique in saying: "I had never gone to the library".

Before building on that thought, I'm going to interupt myself to continue detailing the visit itself.
