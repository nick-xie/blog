Being halfway through my second year at the University of Waterloo, it may surprise some that I made my first trip to the school library only a mere two months ago in late October.

Shocking.

Now, the one thing I omitted with that sentence is that it was the first time I went to the library with the sole intent just to *read*. Sure, I had visited the library before whether it had been for a group study session or to look for a resource for class but I had never simply sat down and enjoyed the silence. And with this small addition, I'm willing to bet that all of a sudden, I'm not so unique in saying: "I had never gone to the library".

Before building on that thought, I'm going to interupt myself to continue detailing the visit itself. The Dana Porter library at the University of Waterloo is by no means a marvel of modern architecture. DP (as members of the UW community call it) is a box of concrete brutalism. It is essentially a cube with thin slits for windows resting atop a rectangular bed of the same design. In short, it's neither the elegent swirl of fine wood and class that one may find at the Douglas Library at Queen's University nor is it a illumination of modern design such as the Bora Laskin Law Library at the University of Toronto.

It does have its own personality though. I ventured up the the third floor where the main reading room is. The interior is a world stuck in the 1980's. Neutral cream coloured walls, wooden book carts whose surfaces may remind one of grade school desks, barren stairwells with quintessential faded yellow terrazzo flooring, and my personal favourite, old weathered posters of students in classic "student poses" such as a textbook under the armpit with a backpack slung over one shoulder and frozen in the air midjump wearing ridiculous oversized bright sweaters with silly slogans. To put it romantically, it was a world straight out of a classic Woody Allen picture.

And even though it was deathly silent in the main area where students were studying, upon entering the reading room itself, outside may have been a subway station at rush hour. The reading room is a fairly large rectangular box with carpeted flooring, comfy plush armchairs, and a wall of various magazines and specials. There was one other person in the room and he was on his computer watching TV with headphones in.

I looked around a bit and picked up the Fall issue of the Lapham's Quarterly. The subject for this edition was "Music", perfect. The magazine is 250ish pages of people throughout time's ideas, thoughts, and perspectives on the given topic. The selection of essays can range from Aristotle's famous words on music and life to an internet discussion from the EDM subreddit. I had a commitment to run to so after reading a few selections from the Quarterly, I couold only spare enough time to read through the October issue of the New Yorker before heading out. It was on my walk out of the library, that I began thinking.

Although I throughouly enjoyed my night at the library, it came with a cost, a startling realization that I had lost my way a little. I've always considered myself artistic by nature so it has always been the case that I have taken time to exercise my more creative pursuits as well as enjoying art as a receiver. There's something about art that has always stood out to me amongst all other pursuits. Something about the finality of it all, the life that it takes on as it goes from idea to existence is enticing to me. When a writer writes or a composer composes, their ideas have concretely been captured and solidified. It can be argued that a goal of all art is to preserve a moment or feeling in a way that simply nothing else can. In that regard, art is perhaps the most natural human goal of all.

Although I love studying math and computer science, I feel that especially as a tech major, amidst the heavy storm of assignments and tests that at times can seem neverending, it is easy to lose a part of oneself in the day to day. It's shockingly too easy to ignore the very humanity of the lives we lead.

My night at the library reminded me of a part of myself that I had forgotten for too long, the part of myself that seeks meaning in my life and asks questions. I look forward to future nights at the library in the upcoming semester. It is this self discovery that turned what on paper seems like a rather mundane night into one of the most memorable days of my fall semester.
